# Wine Analysis
The goal of this project is to predict if a wine will be red or white based off of a variety of different factors.

## Red vs White

As we can see in the graph above, some factors such as Sulphates and Fixed Acidity differe substantially between red and white wines.
Below we can see that all of the factors included in the initial dataset are significant in a linear model to predict if a wine will be red or white.

Additionally, according to VIF (Variance Inflation Factors) density is the only variable that coudl possibly have significant multicolliniarity.
